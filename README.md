Cyber Security Analysis for Backdoor Tyupkin

In this report majorly two types of malware analysis are performed:
 1. Static Malware Analysis:
    Basic static analysis examines malware without viewing the actual code or instructions.
    It employs different tools and techniques to quickly determine whether a file is malicious or not, provide information about its functionality and collect technical indicators to produce simple signatures.
    Technical indicators gathered with basic static analysis can include file name, MD5 checksums or hashes, file type, file size and recognition by antivirus detection tools.
 2. Dynamic Malware Analysis:
    Basic dynamic analysis actually runs malware to observe its behavior, understand its functionality and identify technical indicators which can be used in detection signatures. 
    Technical indicators revealed with basic dynamic analysis can include domain names, IP addresses, file path locations, registry keys, additional files located on the system or network.
    Additionally, it will identify communication with an attacker-controlled external server for command and control purposes or in an attempt to download additional malware files.

About Backdoor Tyupkin:

Virus Type: Virus / Malware 
Also called: Backdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin

What is Tyupkin ?
Tyupkin is a piece of malware that allows cyber criminals to empty cash machines via direct manipulation. This malware, detected by Kaspersky Lab as Backdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin, affects ATMs from a major ATM manufacturer running Microsoft Windows 32-bit.

Virus Threat Details
The cyber criminals work in two stages:

Stage 1 –Access and Infection
First, they gain physical access to an ATM and insert a bootable CD to install the malware – code named Tyupkin (Backdoor.MSIL.Tyupkin). Once the ATM system has been rebooted, the infected ATM is under their control.
Stage 2 – Control and Theft
The infected ATM then runs in an infinite loop waiting for a command. In order to make the scam harder to identify, Tyupkin malware only accepts commands at specific times on Sunday and Monday nights. It is during those times that the cyber criminals are able to steal money from the infected machine.

Methodology
Video Footage obtained from security cameras at the infected ATMs showed the methodology used to access cash from the machines. A unique digit combination key based on random numbers is freshly generated for every session. This ensures that no person outside the gang could accidentally profit from the fraud. Then the malicious operator receives instructions by phone from another member of the cyber-criminal gang who knows the algorithm and is able to generate a session key based on the number shown. This ensures that the mules collecting the cash do not try to go it alone.
When the key is entered correctly, the ATM displays details of how much money is available in each cash cassette, inviting the operator to choose which cassette to rob. After this the ATM dispenses 40 banknotes at a time from the chosen cassette.
